Hi. Welcome to my personal blog.
My name is Bohdan Yarema, I come from Ukraine and am currently located at Eindhoven, Netherlands.
As a senior software engineer I have developed a few creating decisions which I would like to share alongside some tutorials for things which I struggled with at first.

In my free time I enjoy board games, video games, some team sports and cycling.
